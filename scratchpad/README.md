# Scratchpad Directory

This directory serves as a temporary workspace for documents in progress, draft ideas, and experimental content that is not yet ready for the main project structure.

## Purpose

- **Temporary Files**: Store files that are being actively developed before moving them to their proper location
- **Drafts**: Hold draft versions of documentation or code before finalizing
- **Experimental Content**: Test new ideas or approaches without affecting the main project
- **Collaboration Notes**: Share ideas and feedback during development

## Usage Guidelines

1. Files in this directory are considered temporary and may be deleted or archived
2. Important content should be moved to the appropriate project directory when finalized
3. Prefix filenames with "DRAFT-" to indicate work in progress
4. Use this space for AI agent and developer collaboration

## Cleanup

This directory should be cleaned periodically to remove obsolete content and maintain organization.
