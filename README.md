# Brush - 3D reconstruction for all

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7f55b9c-8632-49f9-b34b-d5de52a7a8b0

Brush is a 3D reconstruction engine using [Gaussian splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/). It works on a wide range of systems: **macOS/windows/linux**, **AMD/Nvidia/Intel** cards, **Android**, and in a **browser**. To achieve this, it uses WebGPU compatible tech and the [Burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn) machine learning framework, which has a portable [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) backend.

Training on a pixel 7

# Why

Machine learning for real time rendering has tons of potential, but most ML tools don't align well with it: Rendering requires realtime interactivity, usually involves dynamic shapes, and it's cumbersome to ship apps with large PyTorch/Jax/CUDA deps. The usual fix is to write a separate training and inference application. Brush on the other hand, written in `rust` using `wgpu` and `burn`, can produce simple dependency free binaries, run on nearly all devices, and doesn't require any cumbersome setup.

# Features

## Training

Brush works with _posed_ image data. It can load COLMAP data or datasets in the Nerfstudio format with a transforms.json. Training is fully supported natively, on mobile, and in a browser*.

It also supports masking images:
- Images with transparency. This will force the final splat to match the transparency of the input.
- A folder of images called 'masks'. This ignores parts of the image that are masked out.

While training you can interact with the scene and see the training dynamics live, and compare the current rendering to training or eval views as the training progresses.

(*To train in your browser, you have to load your dataset a zip).

## Viewer
Brush also works well as a splat viewer, including on the web. It can load normal .ply files. It can also stream in data from a URL (for a web app, simply append `?url=`). There's both orbit and flythrough controls.

Brush also can load .zip of splat files to display them as an animation, or a special ply that includes delta frames. This was used for [cat-4D](https://cat-4d.github.io/) and [Cap4D](https://felixtaubner.github.io/cap4d/)!

## CLI
Brush can be used as a CLI. Run `brush --help` to get an overview. Every CLI command can work with `--with-viewer` which also opens the UI, for easy debugging.

## Rerun

While training, additional data can be visualized with the excellent [rerun](https://rerun.io/). To install rerun on your machine, please follow their [instructions](https://rerun.io/docs/getting-started/installing-viewer). Open the ./brush_blueprint.rbl in the viewer for best results.

## Building Brush
First install rust 1.82+. You can run tests with `cargo test --all`. Brush uses the wonderful [rerun](https://rerun.io/) for additional visualizations while training, run `cargo install rerun-cli` if you want to use it.

### Windows/macOS/Linux
Simply `cargo run` or `cargo run --release` from the workspace root. Brush can also be used as a CLI, run `cargo run --release -- --help` to use the CLI directly from source. See the notes about the CLI in the features section.

### Web
This project uses [`trunk`](https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk) to build for the web. Install trunk, and then run `trunk serve` or `trunk serve --release` to run a development server.

WebGPU is still a new standard, and as such, only the latest versions of Chrome work currently. The public web demo is registered for the [subgroups origin trial](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5126409856221184). To run it yourself, please enable the "Unsafe WebGPU support" flag in Chrome.

### Android
See the more detailed README instructions at crates/brush-android.

## Benchmarks

Rendering is generally faster than gsplat, while end-to-end training speeds are similair. You can run benchmarks of some of the kernels using `cargo bench`. For additional profiling, you can use [tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) and run with `cargo run --release --feature=tracy`.
