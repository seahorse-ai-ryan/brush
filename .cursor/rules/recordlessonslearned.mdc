When solving complex technical issues:

1. PROACTIVELY identify opportunities to document lessons learned whenever:
   - A non-obvious bug is discovered and fixed
   - A complex error is resolved (especially compiler/borrow-checker/type errors)
   - A counter-intuitive library behavior is discovered
   - A reusable pattern is created to work around framework limitations
   - Significant debugging techniques are applied to solve an issue

2. WITHOUT WAITING FOR PROMPTING, suggest updating the "brush_lessons.mdc" rule with:
   - The root cause analysis
   - The solution implemented
   - Generalizable lessons for future developers/agents
   
3. Format suggestions:
   - Follow the format specified in the lessons learned rule
   - Be specific about error messages, file locations, and code patterns
   - Highlight "better approaches" that could have prevented the issue

4. Include this documentation step as part of the solution delivery, not as an afterthought.
