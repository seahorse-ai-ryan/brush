# Ryan's Brush Development Workflow

## Environment Setup

My typical development environment setup:

```bash
# Start MCP server for browser tools
cd /Users/ryanhickman/code/brush && npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-server@1.2.0 --port 3025

# In a separate terminal, start Trunk server
cd /Users/ryanhickman/code/brush && trunk serve --no-autoreload --open=false
```

## AI-Assisted Development

When working with AI assistants on the Brush project:

1. **Start each session with context:**
   - Provide the current branch: `new-ui`
   - Mention any recent significant changes
   - Specify the goals for the current session

2. **Debugging process:**
   - Share error logs from MCP server and Trunk
   - Ask the AI to analyze root causes before suggesting fixes
   - Have the AI explain the reasoning behind proposed changes

3. **Documentation updates:**
   - Request that the AI update relevant documentation
   - Have the AI explain where documentation changes fit in the overall doc structure
   - Record lessons learned for common issues

## Common Personal Commands

Commands I frequently use:

```bash
# Kill all development servers
cd /Users/ryanhickman/code/brush && (pkill -f "trunk serve" || true) && (pkill -f "browser-tools-server" || true)

# Quick status check
git status && ls -la .cursor/rules/

# Commit and push workflow files
git add .cursor/rules/ryan_workflow.mdc && git commit -m "Update personal workflow documentation" && git push origin new-ui
```

## NOTE: PERSONAL RULES FILE

This file contains my personal workflow preferences and is not intended for upstream contribution. It should remain in the project's .cursor/rules directory for my own use but should not be pushed to the main repository.
