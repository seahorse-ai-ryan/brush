# Ryan's Brush Development Workflow

## Environment Setup

My preferred development environment setup follows the standard workflow in `brush_dev_workflow.mdc` with these personal modifications:

```bash
# My preferred MCP server startup command
cd /Users/ryanhickman/code/brush && npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-server@1.2.0 --port 3025
```
When using this command with Cursor's AI terminal tool:
- Set `is_background: true` to run in the background
- Set `require_user_approval: false` to prevent opening a new tab

```bash
# My preferred Trunk server command (when running manually)
cd /Users/ryanhickman/code/brush && trunk serve
```
When using this command with Cursor's AI terminal tool:
- Set `is_background: false` to see output directly in the chat
- Set `require_user_approval: false` to prevent opening a new tab

## AI-Assisted Development

When working with AI assistants on the Brush project:

1. **Start each session with context:**
   - Provide the current branch: `new-ui`
   - Mention any recent significant changes
   - Specify the goals for the current session

2. **Debugging process:**
   - Share error logs from MCP server and Trunk
   - Ask the AI to analyze root causes before suggesting fixes
   - Have the AI explain the reasoning behind proposed changes

3. **Documentation updates:**
   - Request that the AI update relevant documentation
   - Have the AI explain where documentation changes fit in the overall doc structure
   - Record lessons learned for common issues

4. **Workflow Integration:**
   - Always hit "Accept All" in the Cursor UI before committing changes
   - AI should never commit changes without explicit confirmation
   - AI should remind you to accept changes before git operations
   - Verify committed changes match what you see in the editor

## Git Workflow Best Practices

When using AI assistants with git:

1. **Before Committing Changes:**
   - AI should always confirm you've accepted changes in Cursor
   - AI should show `git status` before committing to verify what will be included
   - AI should not automatically execute git commit or push operations
   - AI should suggest what to commit and ask for confirmation

2. **After Committing Changes:**
   - AI should show the commit hash or summary for verification
   - AI should confirm successful pushes to remote repositories

## Common Personal Commands

Commands I frequently use:

```bash
# Kill all development servers
cd /Users/ryanhickman/code/brush && (pkill -f "trunk serve" || true) && (pkill -f "browser-tools-server" || true)

# Quick status check
git status && ls -la .cursor/rules/

# Commit and push workflow files
git add .cursor/rules/ryan_workflow.mdc && git commit -m "Update personal workflow documentation" && git push origin new-ui
```

## Rule Organization

For AI-assisted development, refer to:
- `brush_dev_workflow.mdc` - Standard development workflow (always applied)
- `brush_debug.mdc` - Specific debugging techniques (on demand)
- `brush_coding_guide.mdc` - Coding standards and best practices
- `brush_technical.mdc` - Technical implementation details
- `brush_project.mdc` - Project overview and architecture

## NOTE: PERSONAL RULES FILE

This file contains my personal workflow preferences and is not intended for upstream contribution. It should remain in the project's .cursor/rules directory for my own use but should not be pushed to the main repository.
