# 7. Documentation Maintenance

This document outlines how the Brush project documentation is maintained to ensure its accuracy and relevance.

## Process

*   **Pull Requests (PRs):** Documentation updates relevant to code changes (e.g., new features, API modifications, CLI argument changes) should ideally be included in the same Pull Request as the code.
*   **Periodic Reviews:** The documentation should be reviewed periodically by core contributors to ensure accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
*   **Reporting Issues:** Users can report documentation issues (errors, omissions, unclear sections) via the project's GitHub issue tracker, tagging them appropriately (e.g., with a `documentation` label).

## AI Assistance

AI tools (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) may be used as assistants to help draft, update, or summarize documentation content. However:

*   **Verification is Required:** All AI-generated content **must** be thoroughly reviewed, verified for technical accuracy against the current codebase, and edited for clarity by human contributors before being merged.
*   **Focus on Current State:** Documentation should strictly reflect the current, released state of the project, not speculative or future features (as per the [Plan](scratchpad/documentation_plan.md)).
