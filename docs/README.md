# Brush Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Brush project!

This documentation is organized into three main sections to help you find the information you need:

1.  **Guides (`/docs/guides`)**
    *   Practical, step-by-step instructions for users who want to **install, run, and use** Brush. Start with [Installing Brush](./guides/installing-brush.md), then learn about [Training a Scene](./guides/training-a-scene.md), [Viewing Scenes](./guides/viewing-scenes.md), or using the [Command Line Interface](./guides/cli-usage.md).

2.  **Development (`/docs/development`)**
    *   Conceptual explanations and technical details for developers and researchers who want to **understand how Brush works internally** or **modify its code**. Begin with the [Developer Setup](./development/setup.md) and then explore the [Project Architecture](./development/architecture.md), [Core Technologies](./development/core-technologies.md), the [Training & Rendering Pipeline](./development/training-and-rendering.md), [UI Development](./development/ui.md), [Data Handling](./development/data-handling.md), or [Performance](./development/performance.md).

3.  **Reference (`/docs/reference`)**
    *   Technical lookup information. Consult the [Glossary](./reference/glossary.md) for term definitions, review [Configuration Options](./reference/config-options.md), or find notes on [Using Brush as a Library](./reference/api-notes.md).
