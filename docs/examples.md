# 6. Examples

This section describes available examples for Brush.

## 6.1. Overview

Brush includes a limited number of code examples within the `examples/` directory of the repository. These typically demonstrate specific functionalities or crate usage.

For more comprehensive testing and demonstration, the Brush application UI (when run via `cargo run --release`) features a **"Presets" tab**. This tab provides convenient links to download publicly available demo datasets (often hosted as Zip files). These datasets are suitable for testing the full reconstruction and rendering pipeline.

*(TODO: If specific examples exist in `examples/`, analyze them and add them to the index below. Check `examples/Cargo.toml` and individual `main.rs` files within.)*

## 6.2. Example Index

*(Currently, the main way to explore functionality is through the main application or the CLI. This section will be populated if specific, runnable code examples are added to the `examples/` directory.)*
