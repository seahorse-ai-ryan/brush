## Overview

Brush is a tool for creating 3D models from 2D images using Gaussian Splat technology. The process transforms a collection of images into a 3D point cloud representation that can be viewed and exported. The entire pipeline is designed to be user-friendly while providing powerful reconstruction capabilities.

## Dataset Upload

### Supported Input Formats

- **ZIP files**: Collections of images in a compressed format
- **Folders**: Local directories containing image sequences
- **Video files**: Automatically extracted into frame sequences

### Upload Process

1. User initiates upload through the UI by:
   - Clicking the "Add Dataset" button
   - Selecting a ZIP file, folder, or video file
   - Confirming the selection

2. The application validates the input:
   - Checks file format compatibility
   - Verifies image content
   - Estimates available disk space requirements

3. The dataset is registered in the application's index:
   - A unique identifier is assigned
   - Metadata is recorded (size, modification date, etc.)
   - The dataset appears in the datasets panel

## Image Extraction and Processing

Once a dataset is uploaded, the following steps occur:

1. **Extraction**:
   - ZIP files are decompressed
   - Video files are split into individual frames
   - Images are organized in a temporary working directory

2. **Image Analysis**:
   - Resolution and quality assessment
   - EXIF data extraction (if available) for camera parameters
   - Image filtering to remove low-quality or redundant frames

3. **Preprocessing**:
   - Resizing images to optimal dimensions for reconstruction
   - Color correction and normalization
   - Feature detection for matching points across images

The UI displays "Extracting images..." during this phase, with a progress indicator showing completion percentage.

## Camera Pose Estimation

Camera pose estimation is a critical step that determines the spatial relationship between images:

1. **Feature Matching**:
   - Distinctive points are identified in each image
   - Corresponding points are matched across multiple images
   - A sparse point cloud is generated from these matches

2. **Camera Parameter Calculation**:
   - The position and orientation of the camera for each image is determined
   - Intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point) are estimated
   - Distortion coefficients are calculated

3. **Bundle Adjustment**:
   - The initial camera poses are refined through optimization
   - The sparse point cloud is adjusted to minimize reprojection errors
   - A consistent camera trajectory is established

The UI displays "Calculating camera poses..." during this phase, with visual feedback showing the estimated camera positions.

## Initial Reconstruction

With camera poses established, the initial reconstruction begins:

1. **Dense Point Cloud Generation**:
   - Depth maps are created for each image
   - Points are triangulated from multiple views
   - A dense point cloud is formed

2. **Point Cloud Filtering**:
   - Outlier points are removed
   - Noise is reduced
   - The point cloud is normalized

3. **Initial Structure Creation**:
   - The point cloud is organized into a coherent structure
   - Points are assigned initial colors based on source images
   - The structure is prepared for Gaussian splat training

The UI displays "Starting reconstruction..." during this phase, with the initial point cloud visualization beginning to appear.

## Gaussian Splat Training

The core of Brush's reconstruction process is the Gaussian splat training:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Gaussian primitives (splats) are initialized from the point cloud
   - Each splat has a position, orientation, scale, and color
   - Initial density is determined based on point cloud characteristics

2. **Training Process**:
   - The system iteratively refines the splats through optimization
   - Loss functions compare rendered views to original images
   - Splat parameters are adjusted to minimize differences

3. **Progressive Refinement**:
   - Training occurs in steps, with increasing detail
   - Early steps focus on overall structure and positioning
   - Later steps refine appearance and detail

The UI displays "Training step X/Y" during this phase, with real-time updates showing the current training progress and step number.

## Real-time Visualization

Throughout the reconstruction process, Brush provides real-time visualization:

1. **Splat Rendering**:
   - As splats are generated and refined, they are rendered in the 3D view
   - The visualization updates with each training step
   - Users can observe the model taking shape in real-time

2. **Interactive Controls**:
   - Camera controls allow rotation, panning, and zooming
   - Users can inspect the model from different angles
   - The view automatically adjusts to show the most relevant parts of the model

3. **Progress Feedback**:
   - The UI displays the current number of splats
   - Processing status messages indicate the current stage
   - A progress bar shows overall completion percentage

The visualization provides immediate feedback on the quality of the reconstruction, allowing users to decide whether to continue, restart, or adjust parameters.

## Refinement

After the initial training, refinement steps improve the model quality:

1. **Detail Enhancement**:
   - Additional splats are added in areas requiring more detail
   - Existing splats are subdivided where necessary
   - Color and opacity are refined for better visual quality

2. **Consistency Checks**:
   - The model is checked for consistency across different viewpoints
   - Artifacts and errors are identified and corrected
   - Gaps in the reconstruction are filled where possible

3. **Final Optimization**:
   - A final optimization pass ensures the model is as accurate as possible
   - Parameters are fine-tuned for optimal visual quality
   - The model is prepared for export

The UI displays "Refining step X/Y" during this phase, with the model visibly improving with each refinement step.

## Exporting Results

Once reconstruction is complete, users can export the results:

1. **Export Options**:
   - PLY format: Standard point cloud format compatible with many 3D applications
   - Gaussian Splat format: Preserves all splat parameters for future editing
   - Other formats as supported by the application

2. **Export Process**:
   - User selects the desired export format
   - The application automatically generates a filename based on the dataset name and current timestamp
   - Format: `[dataset_name]_[YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS].ply`
   - The model is processed and saved to the specified location

3. **Filename Generation**:
   - The dataset name is extracted from the current dataset being processed
   - A timestamp is added to ensure unique filenames
   - This naming convention makes it easy to identify exports by dataset and creation time

4. **Post-Export Options**:
   - View the exported file location
   - Open the model in an external application
   - Share the model via supported methods

The UI provides clear feedback during and after the export process, confirming successful completion and file location.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Images are loaded using image processing libraries
   - Data is passed to the reconstruction pipeline
   - Temporary files are managed for efficient processing

2. **Reconstruction Pipeline**:
   - The process runs in a separate thread to maintain UI responsiveness
   - Progress updates are sent via message channels
   - The main thread handles visualization and user interaction

3. **Visualization System**:
   - Splats are rendered using GPU acceleration
   - The rendering system optimizes for real-time performance
   - Camera controls translate user input into view transformations

### Key Components

3. **CameraController**: Handles user interaction with the 3D view
4. **RenderState**: Tracks rendering parameters for efficient updates

### Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Management**:
   - Large datasets are processed in chunks
   - Temporary data is cleared when no longer needed
   - GPU memory usage is optimized for available resources

2. **Computation Optimization**:
   - Training uses GPU acceleration where available
   - Multi-threading is employed for CPU-intensive tasks
   - Progressive detail levels balance quality and performance

3. **Visualization Efficiency**:
   - Rendering is optimized based on view distance and importance
   - Level-of-detail techniques reduce complexity for distant objects
   - Frame rate is maintained by adjusting rendering quality dynamically
