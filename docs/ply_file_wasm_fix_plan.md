# PLY File Handling Fix & IndexedDB Implementation Plan

## Issue Analysis

Based on the console errors showing panics and runtime errors in the WASM environment, the following issues are occurring in the new-ui branch:

1. **Filesystem API usage in WASM**: The code is trying to use native filesystem APIs in the web browser context where they aren't available.

2. **Incomplete WASM conditional compilation**: While there are `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` blocks in place for handling files directly in the browser, there are likely code paths missing these conditionals or still attempting filesystem operations.

3. **Stub IndexedDB implementation**: The IndexedDB storage implementation is currently a stub that returns errors, which may be causing panics when the application attempts to use it.

4. **Path handling in browser context**: In the dataset_detail.rs file, there are issues with path handling, where the web context gets empty PathBuf objects that can't be correctly processed.

## Root Cause Analysis

In the main branch, PLY files load correctly because:
1. The code has simpler direct loading of PLY files without attempting to store them persistently
2. It doesn't try to use IndexedDB or the local filesystem for storage

In the new-ui branch, the issues occur because:
1. The code attempts to use more sophisticated persistent storage
2. The IndexedDB implementation is not complete
3. Some code paths don't properly handle the web/native distinction

## Fix Plan (Immediate)

### Phase 1: Fix Direct PLY File Loading in WASM

1. **Modify dataset_detail.rs::set_selected_file**:
   - Ensure the WASM code path completely bypasses filesystem operations
   - When running in the browser, process files directly in memory
   - Use a virtual path instead of filesystem paths

2. **Update app.rs file handling**:
   - Add appropriate `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` blocks
   - Implement direct file data processing instead of filesystem operations
   - Add debug logs to track the file processing flow

3. **Add a build timestamp indicator**:
   - Make the build timestamp visible in the UI (footer)
   - This will help verify when new builds are deployed

### Phase 2: Implement File Testing

1. **Create a diagnostic mode**:
   - Add a URL parameter for diagnostic mode (e.g., `?diagnostic=true`)
   - When enabled, show detailed logs in the UI
   - Test file upload functionality step by step

2. **Automatic testing**:
   - Create a test that tries to load a PLY file from various sources
   - Log each step of the process
   - Report success/failure

## IndexedDB Implementation Plan (Future)

### Phase 1: Core IndexedDB Implementation

1. **Complete IndexedDB Storage Implementation**:
   ```rust
   pub struct IndexedDbStorage {
       db: Mutex<Option<IdbDatabase>>,
   }
   
   impl IndexedDbStorage {
       pub fn new() -> Result<Self> {
           // Initialize with None, will be set during initialize()
           Ok(Self {
               db: Mutex::new(None),
           })
       }
   }
   
   impl DatasetStorage for IndexedDbStorage {
       fn initialize(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
           // Use web_sys to open IndexedDB
           // Create object stores if needed
           // Store database reference
           Ok(())
       }
       
       fn save_dataset(&mut self, name: &str, data: &[u8]) -> Result<()> {
           // Store dataset data in IndexedDB
           Ok(())
       }
       
       // Other methods...
   }
   ```

2. **Update Feature Flag**:
   - Ensure the `web-storage` feature is enabled for WASM builds
   - Update Cargo.toml as needed

### Phase 2: Application Integration

1. **Two-Track Approach**:
   - Implement a mode that allows direct file processing without storage
   - Keep IndexedDB storage as an option for persistent data

2. **UI Integration**:
   - Add UI toggle for enabling/disabling persistent storage
   - Show storage usage statistics

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Gracefully handle storage failures
   - Provide user feedback
   - Fall back to in-memory processing

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. **Dataset Indexing**:
   - Store metadata about datasets
   - Create an index of available PLY files
   - Enable searching and filtering

2. **Storage Management**:
   - Monitor storage usage
   - Implement cleanup functionality
   - Warn users about storage limits

3. **Caching**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed datasets
   - Use service workers for offline support

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test IndexedDB implementation in isolation
   - Mock browser APIs for testing

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test file upload and processing end-to-end
   - Verify storage and retrieval

3. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Test across Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Ensure consistent behavior

## Validation Plan

To validate the fixes:

1. **Console Error Monitoring**:
   - Monitor browser console for errors
   - Ensure no filesystem-related errors occur

2. **Feature Testing**:
   - Upload and process PLY files in the browser
   - Verify rendering works correctly
   - Test with various file sizes and types

3. **Performance Measurement**:
   - Measure loading time with and without storage
   - Evaluate memory usage
   - Check for any performance regressions
