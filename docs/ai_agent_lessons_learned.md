### Issue: UI toggle state not properly synchronized with backend processing

**Context**: The application had a "Live update splats" toggle button in the Controls overlay that visually toggled but didn't actually affect the rendering updates. Additionally, the training toggle state wasn't properly reset when switching to a new dataset.

**Error Symptoms**: 
- The "Live update splats" button would visually toggle on/off, but splats continued to update regardless
- When switching to a new dataset while training was paused, the paused state persisted incorrectly
- UI state and backend processing state were out of sync

**Root Cause**: 
1. The Controls overlay maintained its own state for UI toggles, but this state wasn't properly communicated to the backend processing
2. The message passing system needed a new message type (`ControlMessage::LiveUpdate`) to handle the live update toggle
3. The training process loop needed to filter messages based on the live update state
4. State reset wasn't happening at the right point in the workflow (needed to happen on `StartLoading` not just `NewSource`)

**Solution**: 
1. Added a new control message type for live updates:
```rust
pub enum ControlMessage {
    Paused(bool),
    LiveUpdate(bool),
}
```

2. Modified the process loop to filter TrainStep messages based on the live update state:
```rust
// Send the message if live_update is true or if it's not a TrainStep message
let should_send = match &msg {
    ProcessMessage::TrainStep { .. } => live_update,
    _ => true,
};

if should_send {
    if output.send(msg).await.is_err() {
        return Ok(());
    }
}
```

3. Added state reset on both `NewSource` and `StartLoading` messages:
```rust
ProcessMessage::StartLoading { training } => {
    context.training = training;
    context.loading = true;
    
    // Reset the Controls overlay state when a new dataset starts loading
    self.controls_detail_overlay.reset_state();
}
```

**Better Approach**: A more robust approach would be to implement a proper state management system that:
1. Maintains a single source of truth for application state
2. Provides clear interfaces for UI components to read and update state
3. Automatically propagates state changes to all affected components
4. Handles state persistence and restoration consistently

**Generalizable Lesson**: When implementing UI controls that affect backend processing:
1. Ensure there's a clear message passing mechanism between UI and backend
2. Consider all the points in the workflow where state needs to be reset
3. Design UI components to reflect the actual state of the system, not just their local state
4. For toggles and controls, implement bidirectional state synchronization
5. When adding new features, consider how they interact with existing state management patterns

### Issue: Window resizability issues and inefficient approach to resetting window sizes

**Context**: The application had multiple overlay windows (Datasets, Settings, Stats) that weren't properly resizable, and we needed to implement a way to reset window sizes to their defaults.

**Error Symptoms**: 
- Windows could only be partially resized or not at all
- Initial approach to reset window sizes involved creating duplicate constructors (`new_with_default_size()`) for each overlay
- Window content didn't properly adapt to window size changes
- Some windows appeared too tall and went off-screen

**Root Cause**: 
1. Egui windows weren't properly configured to allow full resizability
2. Content within windows wasn't properly adapting to available space
3. Window state persistence was handled by egui's built-in memory system, but we weren't leveraging it correctly

**Solution**: 
1. Properly configure window content to fill available space:
```rust
// Show the window and get the response
let response = window.show(ctx, |ui| {
    // Set content to fill available space
    ui.set_width(ui.available_width());
    ui.set_height(ui.available_height());
    
    // Use ScrollArea that adapts to available space
    egui::ScrollArea::vertical()
        .auto_shrink([false, false])
        .show_viewport(ui, |ui, _viewport| {
            // Window content here
        });
});
```

2. Use egui's memory system to reset window states instead of duplicate constructors:
```rust
// In App constructor
if reset_windows {
    cc.egui_ctx.memory_mut(|mem| {
        mem.data.clear();
    });
}
```

3. Add a CLI flag to trigger window reset:
```rust
// In CLI struct
/// Reset all window sizes and positions to their default values
#[arg(long, help = "Reset all window sizes and positions to their default values")]
pub reset_windows: bool,
```

**Better Approach**: 
- From the beginning, understand that egui handles window state persistence automatically
- Design window content to adapt to available space using proper layout techniques
- Use egui's memory system for state management rather than creating custom solutions

**Generalizable Lesson**: 
1. When working with egui windows, ensure content adapts to available space:
   - Use `ui.set_width(ui.available_width())` and `ui.set_height(ui.available_height())` to fill space
   - Use `ScrollArea` with `.auto_shrink([false, false])` to prevent content from collapsing
   - Ensure nested layouts properly propagate size constraints

2. For state persistence and reset:
   - Egui automatically persists window positions and sizes in its memory system
   - To reset all window states, clear the memory with `ctx.memory_mut(|mem| { mem.data.clear(); })`
   - Avoid creating duplicate constructors or complex reset mechanisms

3. For proper window configuration:
   - Use `.resizable(true)` to make windows resizable
   - Set reasonable `.min_width()` and `.min_height()` values
   - Use `.default_size()` to set initial size
   - Consider `.default_pos()` to set initial position

4. When adding CLI options:
   - Use clap's `#[arg]` attributes for clear documentation
   - Pass CLI options through the application initialization chain
   - Consider how CLI options interact with persistent state

### Issue: Type mismatches and debugging challenges with egui window responses

**Context**: While fixing the dataset window, we encountered subtle type mismatch errors with egui window responses and difficulties diagnosing window visibility issues without proper debugging.

**Error Symptoms**: 
- Compiler error: `expected bool, found Option<bool>` when trying to access window response data
- Window not appearing despite `open: true` being set
- Difficulty tracking why/when window visibility changed

**Root Cause**: 
1. Egui's window response types are nested and sometimes change between versions
2. The structure of `inner_response.inner` was an `Option<bool>` but code was treating it as `bool`
3. Debugging was insufficient to track window visibility state changes

**Solution**: 
1. Fixed type handling with pattern matching for window responses:
```rust
// Log window response
if let Some(inner_response) = &response {
    println!("DATASET DEBUG: Window response rect: {:?}", inner_response.response.rect);
    
    // Check if the close button was clicked - proper type handling
    if let Some(close_clicked) = inner_response.inner {
        if close_clicked {
            println!("DATASET DEBUG: Close button clicked");
            self.open = false;
        }
    }
} else {
    // Window was closed if no response
    self.open = false;
}
```

2. Added comprehensive visibility debugging:
```rust
// Debugging window visibility state
println!("DATASET DEBUG: is_open() called, returning: {}", self.open);
println!("DATASET DEBUG: set_open({}) called, was: {}", open, self.open);
println!("DATASET DEBUG: show() called, open state: {}", self.open);

// For window changes
if self.open != window_open {
    println!("DATASET DEBUG: Window open state changed: {} -> {}", self.open, window_open);
}
```

**Better Approach**: 
- Use proper pattern matching from the start when working with egui responses
- Add structured debug logging for UI state changes
- Consider creating helper methods to encapsulate egui's response handling patterns

**Generalizable Lesson**: 
1. Egui responses often have nested Option types that require proper unwrapping
2. When UI elements aren't appearing, add debug logging at these key points:
   - Construction (before showing)
   - Inside the rendering closure
   - After receiving the response
   - When state changes
3. Track window and panel sizes at each level of nesting to diagnose layout issues
4. For complex UI bugs, a systematic debugging approach with explicit state logging is essential
5. Create helper functions for common egui patterns to avoid repetitive and error-prone code

### Issue: Borrow checker errors when using `self` inside egui window closures with window state management

**Context**: While fixing the dataset detail overlay, we encountered multiple borrow checker errors when trying to use `self` inside egui closures while also passing `&mut self.open` to the window's `.open()` method.

**Error Symptoms**: 
- Rust compiler error `E0500`: "closure requires unique access to `*self` but it is already borrowed"
- Specifically: 
  ```
  error[E0500]: closure requires unique access to `*self` but it is already borrowed
  --> src/overlays/dataset_detail.rs:308:41
     |
  297 |             .open(&mut self.open) // Critical - this allows the window to close properly
     |                   -------------- borrow occurs here
  ...
  308 |         let response = window.show(ctx, |ui| {
     |                               ----      ^^^^ closure construction occurs here
     |                               |
     |                               first borrow later used by call
  ...
  400 |                                         self.select_folder();
     |                                         ---- second borrow occurs due to use of `*self` in closure
  ```

**Root Cause**: Egui's window creation pattern creates a conflict between:
1. Passing `&mut self.open` to the window's `.open()` method, which borrows `self` mutably
2. Using `self` inside the window's content closure, which requires another mutable borrow of `self`

This creates an overlapping mutable borrow scenario that Rust's borrow checker forbids.

**Solution**: 
- Use local variables to avoid the double borrow
- Track window state in a local variable and synchronize back to `self` after the closure
- For callbacks like "select folder", use flag variables that are set inside the closure and checked afterward:

```rust
// Track open state locally to avoid borrow issues
let mut window_open = self.open;

// Flag for callbacks
let mut should_select_folder = false;

// Create the window with local variable reference
let window = egui::Window::new("Datasets")
    .id(window_id)
    .open(&mut window_open) // Use local variable instead of self.open
    .resizable(true)
    // ...more window options...
    
let response = window.show(ctx, |ui| {
    // Inside closure - set flags instead of calling self methods
    if ui.button("Select Folder").clicked() {
        should_select_folder = true;
    }
    // ...more UI code...
});

// After closure - update self based on local variables
self.open = window_open;

// Handle actions that were flagged inside the closure
if should_select_folder {
    self.select_folder();
}
```

**Better Approach**: Design UI components with the borrow checker in mind from the beginning:
- Keep all UI state in separate fields that can be borrowed independently
- Use a design pattern where UI rendering doesn't require extensive self-referencing
- Consider separating UI state from application logic more explicitly

**Generalizable Lesson**: When working with egui in Rust:
1. Be careful of the pattern "window.open(&mut self.field).show(|ui| { self.other_method() })" - this is a borrow checker violation
2. Use local variables and flags to track UI state and actions during rendering
3. Update the component state from these local variables after the UI closure completes
4. Remember that closures capture their environment, creating hidden borrows the compiler must track
5. Design your component API to minimize self-referential patterns that could create borrow conflicts

### Issue: Window only resized horizontally but not vertically despite being configured as resizable

**Context**: The user was working with a dataset browser window in an egui-based application. The window was intended to be fully resizable in both dimensions, but users could only resize it horizontally.

**Error Symptoms**: 
- Window could be dragged to resize horizontally, but vertical resizing had no effect
- No error messages in the console, making the issue hard to diagnose
- Debug logs showed layout calculations resulted in 0 or negative available height for data area
- Example debug output: `Available height: 0, reserved: 150` despite window being 410px tall

**Root Cause**: Improper layout hierarchy in egui. The window used nested horizontal and vertical layouts, but the horizontal layout wasn't propagating vertical space correctly to its children. This caused inner components to have zero available height despite the window having sufficient height.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced manual horizontal+vertical layout hierarchy with egui's purpose-built `SidePanel` component
- Added explicit height constraints to make components claim their proper vertical space
- Applied the following key changes:
  ```rust
  // CRITICAL CHANGE: Use a main vertical layout for the entire window content
  ui.vertical(|ui| {
      // Force UI to take all available space
      ui.set_min_size(egui::vec2(ui.available_width(), ui.available_height()));
      
      // Use SidePanel for left side which handles resizing properly
      egui::SidePanel::left("dataset_browser_panel")
          .resizable(true)
          .min_width(280.0)
          .default_width(300.0)
          .max_width(ui.available_width() * 0.8)
          .show_inside(ui, |ui| {
              // Force panel to use all available height
              ui.set_min_height(ui.available_height());
              // ...content...
          });
  });
  ```

**Better Approach**: From the beginning, use egui's specialized layout components (`SidePanel`, `CentralPanel`, etc.) rather than manually nesting horizontal and vertical layouts. These built-in components handle sizing and resizing correctly in both dimensions.

**Generalizable Lesson**: When working with egui (or any immediate mode GUI):
1. Prefer specialized layout components over manual nested layouts when available
2. Add comprehensive debug logging for layout dimensions when resizing issues occur
3. Pay close attention to how height/width constraints propagate through nested layouts
4. Use `.set_min_size()` and `.set_min_height()` explicitly to claim available space
5. For scroll areas, use `.auto_shrink([false; 2])` to prevent them from collapsing when empty

### Issue: UI overlays losing state and not properly reflecting application state

**Context**: The application had multiple overlay windows (Stats, Controls) that were losing their state when new datasets were loaded or training started. The Stats window would disappear, and the Controls panel would incorrectly show "No active training session" even when training was in progress.

**Error Symptoms**: 
- Stats window would disappear when a new dataset started processing
- Controls panel would show "No active training session" despite active training
- Export button and other training controls were not available when they should be
- Window state (open/closed) was not preserved across state transitions

**Root Cause**: 
1. When handling messages like `NewSource` and `StartLoading`, the overlays were being reset without preserving their open/closed state
2. The message forwarding system was inconsistent - some messages were sent to panels but not to overlays
3. The Controls panel was relying on its internal state rather than checking the AppContext's training state directly
4. Message handling was happening at different points in the update cycle, causing state inconsistencies

**Solution**: 
1. Modified the `on_message` methods to preserve window state when resetting:
```rust
pub(crate) fn on_message(&mut self, message: &ProcessMessage) {
    match message {
        ProcessMessage::NewSource => {
            // Save the current open state
            let was_open = self.open;
            let position = self.position;
            
            // Reset the overlay but preserve open state
            *self = Self::new(self.device.clone(), self.adapter_info.clone());
            
            // Restore the open state and position
            self.open = was_open;
            self.position = position;
        }
        // ...
    }
}
```

2. Updated the App to forward messages to all overlays consistently:
```rust
for message in messages {
    // Forward message to the Controls overlay
    self.controls_detail_overlay.on_message(&message);
    
    match &message {
        // ...
    }
}
```

3. Modified the Controls panel UI to check the AppContext's state directly:
```rust
// Check the AppContext's training state directly
if context.training() {
    // Show training controls
} else {
    // Show non-training message
}
```

4. Added explicit handling for training-related messages in the Controls overlay:
```rust
ProcessMessage::TrainStep { .. } => {
    // No longer force the panel to open on every train step
    // This allows users to close the panel if they wish
},
```

**Better Approach**: A more robust approach would be to:
1. Implement a centralized state management system that all UI components observe
2. Use a proper observer pattern where UI components register for state changes
3. Separate UI state (window positions, sizes) from application state (training status)
4. Use a more declarative UI approach where components render based on application state

**Generalizable Lesson**: 
1. When implementing UI overlays and panels that respond to application state:
   - Always check the source of truth (AppContext) directly in the render method
   - Don't rely solely on internal state that might become stale
   - Preserve UI state (open/closed, position) when resetting content state

2. For message handling:
   - Forward messages consistently to all components that need them
   - Handle messages at a consistent point in the update cycle
   - Be explicit about which state is reset and which is preserved

3. For debugging UI state issues:
   - Add logging for state transitions
   - Check both the UI component's internal state and the application state
   - Test all possible state transitions (loading → training → paused → resumed)

4. For export functionality:
   - Generate meaningful default filenames that include context (dataset name, timestamp)
   - Navigate directory structures intelligently to extract meaningful names
   - Provide fallbacks when expected structure isn't found

# UI Element Reopening After User Closure

## Problem Description
The Controls window in the application couldn't be permanently closed by the user. When clicking the X button to close the window, it would briefly disappear but then immediately reappear.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `on_message` method of the `ControlsDetailOverlay` class. The method contained logic that forced the window to reopen (`self.open = true`) whenever a `TrainStep` message was received:

```rust
brush_process::process_loop::ProcessMessage::TrainStep { .. } => {
    // Make sure the panel is open when training steps are received
    self.open = true;
},
```

Since training steps are received continuously during an active training session, this meant that even if a user closed the window, it would immediately reopen on the next training step message, which could happen multiple times per second.

## Solution
The solution was to modify the `on_message` method to respect the user's choice to close the window by removing the line that forces the window to open on every `TrainStep` message:

```rust
brush_process::process_loop::ProcessMessage::TrainStep { .. } => {
    // No longer force the panel to open on every train step
    // This allows users to close the panel if they wish
},
```

The Controls window will still open automatically when training starts (via the `StartLoading` and `DoneLoading` messages), but once training is in progress, the user can close it if they wish, and it will stay closed.

## Lessons Learned
1. **Respect User Interactions**: UI elements should generally respect user interactions like closing a window, unless there's a critical reason to override them.

2. **Be Cautious with Frequent Events**: When handling frequent events (like training steps that occur many times per second), be careful not to override user preferences in each event handler.

3. **UI State Management**: When designing UI components that respond to system events, clearly separate the initialization logic (when the component should first appear) from the update logic (how it responds to ongoing events).

4. **Message Handling Hierarchy**: Consider implementing a hierarchy of message importance. Some messages (like starting training) might justify opening a closed panel, while others (like routine updates) should respect the current visibility state.
