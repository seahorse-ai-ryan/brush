# 7. Documentation Maintenance

This document outlines how the Brush project documentation can be maintained to ensure its accuracy and relevance over time.

## Process for Keeping Docs Up-to-Date

*   **Contributions with Code:** Contributors are encouraged to include relevant documentation updates (e.g., for new features, API changes, CLI arguments) within the same Pull Request as their code changes.
*   **Community Review:** Ideally, the documentation benefits from periodic reviews by contributors to ensure accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
*   **Reporting Issues:** Specific documentation problems (errors, omissions, unclear sections) can be reported via the project's GitHub issue tracker, ideally using a `documentation` label.
*   **Discussion:** For broader discussions about documentation structure, priorities, or needed improvements, please use the project's [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/TbxJST2BbC) (linked in the main README).

## AI Assistance & Verification

A significant portion of this initial documentation set was drafted with AI assistance (primarily Gemini 2.5 Pro within Cursor). While helpful for generating a baseline, this highlights the critical need for ongoing human review and maintenance.

*   **Verification is Required:** All AI-generated or AI-assisted content **must** be thoroughly reviewed, verified for technical accuracy against the current codebase, and edited for clarity by human contributors before being merged or accepted.
*   **Focus on Current State:** Documentation should strictly reflect the current, released state of the project, not speculative or future features.
