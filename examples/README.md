# Brush Examples

## Overview

This directory contains specific examples demonstrating particular functionalities or integrations within the Brush codebase, rather than general user-facing examples run via `cargo run --example`.

The primary way for users to experiment with Brush and common datasets is through its main application (`brush_app`) using either the UI or the CLI.

*   **UI Presets:** The **Presets** panel in the UI provides easy access to download and load standard datasets (Mipnerf, Synthetic Blender scenes).
*   **CLI Loading:** You can load datasets or pre-trained `.ply` files via the command line as shown in the **[User Guide Workflows](../docs/getting_started/user-guide.md#212-basic-workflows-step-by-step)**.

## Specific Examples

*   **`train-2d/`**: _(Add brief description if known, e.g., "Demonstrates 2D training or visualization")_

*(This section would list other specific examples if they were added.)*
